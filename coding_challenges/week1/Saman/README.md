If you have a Python IDE use that to run this code or follow Tims instructions below (below)

Quickstart:

To run, first download the latest version of Python 3.

To check Python has correctly installed, type py -V into Terminal/Command prompt. (If this doesn't work, try python -V or python3 -V.)

To run the program, type

py [path of binary_search.py - e.g. "C:\development_practice\coding_challenges\week1\Saman\BinarySearchWin.py"] OR py [path of binary_search.py - e.g. "C:\development_practice\coding_challenges\week1\Saman\BinarySearchFail.py"]

-------------------Thanks Tim--------------------

Note I have a win and a fail. One I used a while loop and it works fine. The other I attemped to use a recursive function (a function that calls itself). I can get the correct answer to print to the screen but not to return a value. There's more details in the script describing the issue, if you know how to fix it let me know please!
