# Binary Tree #

### This challenge is to code a Binary Tree that follows these rules:

* Each node has between 0 and 2 child nodes.
* If present, the left child always has a value <= the value of the parent node.
* If present, the right child always has a value > the value of the parent node.
* The nodes have a value of type int.

### Then extend your Binary Tree implementation to provide the following functionality:

* Insert Node
* Delete Node
* Test that the Tree contains a given Node (by int value). Only need return true/false, don't need position.
* Return the maximum depth of the Tree
* Return whether or not the Tree is balanced (you can look the definition of a balanced tree up, but suffice to say it probably won't be in this implementation, as we're not including any balancing algo ...... yet).
* Return the Nodes of the Tree as an 'In Order' array of values.

__Your solution should include unit testing for each item of functionality.__
